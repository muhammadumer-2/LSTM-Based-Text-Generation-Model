# LSTM-Based Text Generation Model

This project is a deep learning model for text generation using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The model is trained on text data extracted from a PDF document. The core tasks include data preprocessing, model training, and text generation.

## Project Overview

This project builds a text generator model using the following steps:
- **Data extraction** from a PDF document.
- **Preprocessing** of extracted text into a format suitable for training.
- Building and training a **neural network** model using LSTM layers.
- Generating text based on a user-provided seed phrase using the trained model.

## Features

- Extract text from PDF files.
- Preprocess the text to prepare it for model training (removal of punctuation, tokenization).
- Train an LSTM model using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Generate new text sequences based on a seed phrase.
- Evaluate model accuracy on a validation set.
